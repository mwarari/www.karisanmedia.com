				<p>Isaac Newton Kinity (born August 1954 in Elburgon, Kenya) is the Chairman of KIKIMO Foundation for Corruption & Poverty Eradication. Mr. Kinity was born in an era characterized by poverty and a struggling Kenya and his early childhood was characterized by many challenges associated with poverty and a very tough living environment. This includes the death of his father from poisoning by a fellow school teacher when Newton was only six months old.
Mr. Kinity went to the University of New Haven, Connecticut; U.S.A. in 2003 where he was elected Secretary of the Undergraduate Student Government Association from 2004 to 2005.
Originally from Elburgon, Kenya, Kinity is described a relentless human rights activist who will stop at nothing while demanding justice, accountability and transparency. He has been involved in many organizations that champion good governance, accountability and transparency. One such role is as Chairman of a clandestine revolutionary movement-K.R.R.C. (Kenya Revolutionary Redemption Council - K.R.R.C.) that was fighting for good governance in Kenya during the Daniel arap Moi era and also Secretary General of the Kenya Civil Servants Union in the period 1995 through 1998. Kinity was considered to be a major thorn in former presidents Moi side and the Moi Regime organized for Kinity's "termination" 6 times. He is a human rights activist who has vowed never to stop the fight for the justice and the rights of Kenyan nationals and all citizens of any country around the world.
Kinity has served in various capacities in various organizations concerned with fighting corruption, violation of civil rights, refugee services, Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) and students. Kinity is or has been an official for several organizations, and has been demanding transparency and accountability in government and all facets of society. One such demand was for an account of some 30 Million Shillings (US$ 430,000) donated by the Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA) to the Kenya Water Institute . These funds were meant to pay for the expansion of the institute but misappropriated by the Principal of Kenya Water Institute in or around 1988.
Mr. Kinity was also subjected to harassment and intimidation by the former president Daniel arap Moi Regime between the years 1995 through 1998 while fighting for the legal rights and benefits of civil servants as well as the fight against corruption within Kenya. Though Mr. Kinity partially recovered from one of the 6 attempt on his life, the attempt led to Kinity's loss of eyesight and paralysis in his right side.
Kinity would eventually seek help for treatment from friends and comrades within the Africa Trade Union Movement before his eventual escape to Uganda and hence to the United States of America to evade the threats on his life. While in the United States, Mr. Kinity has maintained an active role in the U.S. Civil rights movement and engaged in many community projects that help refugees, fellow members of the Kenya Community and most recently, started advocating for the assistance of Kenya’s Internally Displaced Persons .
