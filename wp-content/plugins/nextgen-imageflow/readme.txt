Finn Rudolphs picture gallery for NextGEN Gallery. Digital animation for thumbing through a physical image stack.

== Description ==

[Finn Rudolphs](http://imageflow.finnrudolph.de/) picture gallery for NextGEN Gallery. Digital animation for thumbing through a physical image stack. Go to the [our forum](http://shabushabu-webdesign.com/support-forum/) for support and more information.

Check [NextGEN FlashViewer](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/nextgen-flashviewer/) for another add-on for your NextGEN Gallery.


== Installation ==

1. Upload the files (except reflect2.php and reflect3.php) to wp-content/plugins/nextgen-imageflow

2. **IMPORTANT:** Check if reflect2.php and reflect3.php have been copied to your Wordpress root folder. If not, then copy them over manually.

3. Activate the plugin

4. Go to Gallery->ImageFlow and change the options to your liking

5. Go to your post and enter tag like [imageflow id="GALLERY-ID"]

That's it ... enjoy!


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I installed everything, but I don't see any images. What am I doing wrong? =

Check if you have uploaded reflect2/3.php to your Wordpress root folder (the directory where your wp-config.php file is in).

= My images don't seem to get cached? =

For the caching to work you have to use the NGG default paths, as NextGEN ImageFlow uses the same cache folder as NGG. So that would be wp-content/gallery/cache.

= But I changed that path. What can I do? =

Open reflect2/3.php, go down to around line 80 and adjust this line $cache_dir = dirname(__FILE__).'/wp-content/gallery/cache';

= Anything else I should know? =

Well, now you can use a reflection with any image on your blog that is not part of your NextGEN Gallery. Instead of referencing the URL of your image you can now write something like this:
src="path/to/WP-root-folder/reflect2.php?img=relative/path/to/image.jpg&amp;bgc=ffffff".
