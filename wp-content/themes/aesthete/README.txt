	The theme was tested on wordpress 2.8+
	Requirements:

	- your wordpress uploads dir must be writable

INSTALLATION

	1. Upload complete folder "aesthete" to your web hosting 
	   to /your-wordpress-install/wp-content/themes/

	2. Configure the theme at Your Blog -> Site Admin -> Appearance -> Aesthete Theme Options
	   See also "How to use portfolio" and "How to use catalogue" sections
	
	3. Activate the theme
	
SOME WORDS ON CUSTOM HEADER

	To use your own header image do the following:
	
	1. Upload your own header image to your hosting to 
	   /your-themes-folder/aesthete/img/headers. 
	   You will probably use an ftp-client to do this.
	
	2. Go to the theme options and set "Header Image" option to "Your Image".
	   All available images (including your one) will be displayed.
	
	3. Select your image
	
	4. Save changes.

	You can download source PSD-files that can help you to make an image at 
	http://vatuma.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/psd.zip

	Please keep in mind that the theme is designed to show Blog Title at the
	right of the image. This means that if your image is quite wide, the
	Blog Title will be moved to the next line and a vertical space between the image
	and blog title will appear. You can either use smaller image or hide blog title
	throu the theme options.
	

SUGESTED PLUGINS
	
	1. Slimbox Plugin (http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/slimbox-plugin/)
	   It can be used in the catalogue functionality
	
	2. Pagebar2 (http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/pagebar/)
	   Use it only for the multipaged posts. Uncheck "Automagic insertion" in the 
	   plugin config.
	   
	3. WP-Paginate (http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-paginate/)
	   Use it for all other pagination

HOW TO USE PORTFOLIO

	The portfolio is designed to use one post for one work. This allows you to 
	describe your work, insert more images and so on.
	
	To use portfolio:
	
	1. Create a category. For example "Portfolio".
	
	2. Select the category in the theme options as "Portfolio Category"
	
	3. Create a post in the Portfolio category. SAVE the post.
	
	4. Upload preview image INTO THE POST. The Image should appear in the "Gallery" Tab.
 
	   The image containing the word "thumb" in it's filename (e.g. "mywork_thumb.jpg") 
	   will be considered as thumbnail.
	   Otherwise the first image will be taken (see "Order" field while uploading images).
	   If the thumbnail image is smaller then the size set in theme options it will 
	   not be resized.
	
	5. (Optionaly) Insert images into post.
	
	6. PUBLISH the post.

	7. Repeat steps 3-6 for each work.

HOW TO USE CATALOG
	
	Catalog is almost the same as portfolio. Separate category, one post - one item 
	(catalog item, commodity).
	The differences are:
	   - it's available to show more then one image preview in item list
	   - item description (post excerpt) is shown in list
	   - no need to insert images into a post. 
	     All uploaded images will ALWAYS be shown automaticaly
	   - a catalogue can have subcategories
